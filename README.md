# webmulator-reborn
a better more modern and easier to use version of webmulator I will also provide rom files that are usable in the roms folder every now and then
> [!WARNING]
> 
> **this is still under __HEAVY__ testing.**
>  - Please be patient :)
>
> **I also made a version that includes a rom patcher at: [`Webmulator++`](https://twelv12-mon.github.io/webmulator-reborn/adv/index.html) there is also a ai patch file generator you can go to on the page if you don't have any patch files.**

# NOTICE!!
---
> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **The advanced version is very buggy and even I can't really use it so it is suggested that you just use the normal version: https://twelv12-mon.github.io/webmulator-reborn/**
